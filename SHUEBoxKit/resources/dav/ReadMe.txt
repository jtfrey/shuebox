[[ Welcome to SHUEBox! ]]

You are working with a WebDAV repository.  WebDAV repositories behave just like the other 
disks you have attached to your computer, allowing you to:

  * copy files from the repository to your computer
  * copy files from your computer to the repository

In most instances you can also open files in the repository right from your desktop 
applications like Word, PowerPoint, etc.


Please note that WebDAV repositories are a _shared_ resource:  this means that changes you 
save or upload to the repository may overwrite changes that another user with access to the 
repository has already made.  Users seeking a repository which enforces stronger editorial 
workflows may want to create a Subversion (revision controlled) repository rather than a 
WebDAV repository.
