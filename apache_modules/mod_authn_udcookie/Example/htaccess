#
# Example .htaccess file; configures a directory which will
# check for a valid ud-nss-auth cookie and if not found will
# do a file-based Basic authentication.
#
# If the AuthUDCookieAuthoritative directive were uncommented
# the directory would _require_ a valid cookie, period.
#
# The AuthUDCookieUpdate* directives are used to automatically
# refresh the expiration timestamping on the cookie.  This
# is useful primarily because a directory of static content
# has no other means of updating a cookie to extend a user's
# access based on activity alone!  Granted, one could leverage
# a session cookie for this kind of thing, but this module wants
# to be as flexible as possible.  Setting the TTL to a number of
# seconds > 0 enables this feature; the Path and Domain are
# optional.
